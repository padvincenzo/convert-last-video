# Convert last video
Convert last edited (or created) mkv video to an mp4 video, using ffmpeg. I am using this script to atutomate the conversion of recordings generated by OBS.

To use it, put the script in ``~/Video/OBS`` (or in the folder that will contains your OBS recordings) and, when you stop a recording, just type ``~/Video/OBS/convert_last.sh`` in the terminal. In my personal configuration, this script save up to 75% of disk usage. *No magic, ffmpeg does the hard work*
